### Overview

This course teaches you the algorithmic fundamentals you need, in order to be an informed, 
well-rounded practitioner of artificial intelligence. At a high level, it 
focuses on three types of reasoning: search-based, probabilistic, and logical. 
While you likely have some experience with all three of these subjects in previous
classes, the focus of this course will be on: (a) coming to terms with the
fact that almost everything we want to do is NP-hard or worse, and
then (b) sometimes successfully doing it anyway.


### Coursework

**Homework:** There will be weekly homework assignments, typically assigned on Monday
and due the following Monday.

**Projects:** There will be two projects during the course. The first project will be due
approximately around the same time as the first exam, and will give you experience in 
devising a soup-to-nuts solution to a search problem. The second project will be due during
the final week of class, and will require you to create a graphics application that
showcases one (or more) of the concepts introduced during the class. This second project
is open-ended -- creativity and ambition are encouraged.

**Exams:** There will be three exams during the course: two midterms and a 
final. Each exam is weighted equally and covers one module of the course.
In other words, there will be one exam about search-based reasoning, one exam about 
probabilistic reasoning, and one exam about logical reasoning. The final will not be 
comprehensive of the entire course and will not be worth more than the midterms. 

### Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of the course, a student should:

1. Understand introductory concepts in AI search, as demonstrated by the following skills:
  - Implement and analyze uninformed search strategies such as BFS, DFS, and depth-limited search, and bidirectional search 
  - Implement heuristics in informed search strategies, as well as identify the aspects of a good heuristic
  - Implement and analyze simple game search algorithms, e.g. minimax and alpha-beta pruning
2. Understand introductory concepts in probabilistic models and reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by the following skills:
  - Construct probabilistic models of uncertainty and compute/understand associated concepts like d-separation.
  - Implement a reinforcement learning engine for a simple scenario, like learning to play blackjack.
3. Understand introductory concepts in AI logic, as demonstrated by the following skills:
  - Express logical statements using propositional and first-order logic, and understand the ontological difference between propositional and first-order logics. 
  - Apply and analyze logical inference algorithms, such as resolution and forward/backward chaining

### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments will be posted on the website a minimum of two days 
in advance of each lecture. I will assume that the reading is done prior 
to lecture. 


### Disability Accommodation

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your professor and the
Office of Disability Support Services.
